# Brick Breaker Game:

This repository contains the source code for a replication of Brick Breaker (1999) implemented entirely in Assembly Language (x86) using Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), as part of the final project for the Computer Organisation &amp; Assembly Language (EE2003) course.

## Introduction:

Brick Breaker is a platform game (platformer) in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle that moves horizotally and is controlled by the player. The player gets three lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, more difficult level. There are three levels in total, and the final level has invisible bricks to deflect the bouncing ball in unpredictable directions. If all lives are lost, the game is over. However, to win the game, all the bricks need to be smashed (even the invisible ones).
